# File-Organizer-by-EXT
This python file will organize a directory by filetype. Pre-existing sub-directories will be placed in a file called DIRECTORIES. It will create a file called directory-list.txt, which is important not to delete if its intended to run more than once. It can be run from the command line by doing "python3 fileorganizer.py ~/DIRECTORYNAME movedir" or "python3 fileorganizer.py SUBDIRECTORY_OF_CURRENT movedir". The third command is either "movedir" or "keepdir". This determines if your current directories are put into the DIRECTORIES folder or not. If you execute it on a directory with the command "python3 fileorganizer.py SUBDIRECTORY_OF_CURRENT keepdir" and then run it again with the command "python3 fileorganizer.py SUBDIRECTORY_OF_CURRENT movedir", it will leave the directories you previously told it to leave in place where they are.
